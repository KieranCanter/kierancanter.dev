  bio: "I'm Kieran, a computer scientist with a passion for not only designing, developing, and deploying software, but most importantly, <span class='highlight'>impressing</span>. I prefer to call myself a computer scientist because of my deep enthusiasm for various aspects of the discipline like software engineering, web development, data science, algorithms & data structures, object-oriented programming, and theoretical mathematics. More than anything, I value my teachability and aptitude for quickly learning new concepts.<br><br>Initially, my interest in computers stemmed from a friend showing me little programs he would write on his TI-84 calculator. This sparked a curiosity in me which led to custom PC build videos populating my YouTube feed. Hooked on hardware, I researched and built my own computer, obsessed with consumer technology. Naturally, I headed off to college in pursuit of a Computer Engineering degree... until I discovered how disinterested I was in the electrical engineering side of the field. I fell in love with the programming and math involved in software and expeditiously switched majors, finishing up at the University of Maryland, College Park with a B.S. in Computer Science.<br><br>Nowadays, I'm a <span class='highlight'>Software Engineer</span> who happens to enjoy <span class='highlight'>weightlifting</span>, <span class='highlight'>MMA</span>, <span class='highlight'>philosophy</span>, <span class='highlight'>financial literacy</span>, and of course, <span class='highlight'>coding for fun</span>.<br><br>Some of my favorite technologies:",
