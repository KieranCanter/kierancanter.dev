## Impress

I built my portfolio website to serve as a central hub for presenting myself as a distinct, branded computer scientist. I wanted a place where I could showcase my skills, projects, and professional identity in a minimalist yet polished manner. This site reflects my desire to develop applications to not just function, but to **impress**.

## Design

Driven by a desire to capture a modern, clean aesthetic that still delivers a unique visual, I focused on creating a minimalist yet engaging layout, balancing simplicity with functional elegance. My goal was to prioritize user experience, ensuring intuitive navigation and seamless accessibility across devices. Typography and color schemes were carefully selected to craft a professional and inviting atmosphere that hopefully not only highlights my work but also reflects upon my creativity as a computer scientist.

### Inspiration

I derived many innovation ideas, elements, and concepts from various websites that I admire. Below are the authors of sites that I gained inspiration from and revere as beautiful and exceptionally crafted in one facet or another:

* [Ansub Khan](https://ansubkhan.com)
* [Anthony Fu](https://antfu.me)

### Figma Mock-up

The first step of development was visual design. I took to [Figma](https://figma.com) to establish potential color schemes, layouts, spacing, content, etc. [As you can see](https://www.figma.com/design/tP5ITD5rjftAeg27rMoVXG/kierancanter.dev?node-id=0-1&t=z3MOAOBTCVDuCq4r-1), the original design looks almost nothing like the final product, but it laid out the ground work that displayed flaws and eventually allowed me to perform iterations upon iterations of refinements.

### Colors

Colors play an extremely important part in how the audience visually perceives your content. Black and white can emit elegance while vibrant colors are more playful. Earth tones come across as more subdued but give off a natural, organic feel. Colors are also important for accessibility purposes. Designs need to ensure that contrast between opposing colors is high enough such that those with color blindness can still detect differences in overlapping colors. Believe it or not, my original color scheme was inspired by [Hyper Shadow](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Shadow) from Sonic. I remember being obsessed with the pale gold + burgundy combo while playing the final stage of Sonic Adventure 2: Battle as a kid, and I have loved the pairing ever since.

## Prototyping

To mock-up more technical aspects of the site, I shifted to [CodePen](https://codepen.io). This is where I toyed around with conceptual prototypes of possible components and could really draft the HTML/CSS/JS in a more abstracted environment.
