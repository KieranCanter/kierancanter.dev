I prefer to call myself a computer scientist because I have a deep enthusiasm for so many different aspects of the discipline, like software engineering, web development, data science, algorithms & data structures, object-oriented programming, and theoretical mathematics. More than anything, I value my teachability and my ability to pickup new concepts quickly.<br><br>I first gained an interest in computers in high school, where a friend of mine would show me little programs he had written into his TI-84 calculator. I started watching custom PC build videos on YouTube and got hooked on hardware, enough to research and build my own PC. Naturally, I headed off to the University of Maryland, College Park, in pursuit of a Computer Engineering degree... until I discovered how disinterested I was in the electrical engineering side of the field. I fell in love with the programming and math involved in computer science and switched majors, expeditiously.<br><br>Nowadays, I'm a <span class='highlight'>Software Engineer</span> who happens to enjoy <span class='highlight'>weightlifting</span>, <span class='highlight'>MMA</span>, <span class='highlight'>philosophy</span>, <span class='highlight'>financial literacy</span>, and of course, <span class='highlight'>coding for fun</span>.<br><br>Some of my favorite technologies:",
